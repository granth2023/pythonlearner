#in js some fucntions that dont get hoisted like funciton expressions and arrow functions. only delcarations will get hoisted in JS -- in Python you cant call a function until after you define it. 

#can we have call back functions? what is a third thing we can pass into computer? what does op stnad for? it could be cat? hwo do we call it? call op and return ab 

#we return cat passing a and b and then print computer 1,2, and then what you want to do like add

#is this calling fucntions

#does python require amount of things? if you define fucntion add with and ab you can't just call add? it will not call add 

#what is tuple
